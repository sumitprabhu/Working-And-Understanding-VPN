## VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

### How VPNs Work
- VPNs create an **encrypted tunnel** between your device and a secure VPN server.
- Your internet traffic is **routed through this tunnel**, hiding your real IP and encrypting data from ISPs, trackers, or potential attackers.

### Encryption Protocols Used
- **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** (used by ProtonVPN)
- AES-256 encryption standard ensures data confidentiality.

### Privacy Advantages
- Hides your **IP address** and location.
- Bypasses **geo-restrictions** and censorship.
- Secures data on **public Wi-Fi** networks.
- Reduces tracking by **advertisers and ISPs**.

---

## VPN Benefits

- **Enhanced Online Privacy**: Real IP masked.
- **Secure Communication**: Strong encryption for all outgoing/incoming traffic.
- **Access Blocked Content**: Reach geo-restricted or censored sites.
- **Protects on Public Wi-Fi**: Safe browsing in airports, cafes, etc.

---

## VPN Limitations

- **Slower Speeds**: Encryption can reduce browsing speed.
- **Limited Server Options** (on free tiers).
- **Not Full Anonymity**: VPN providers may log data (choose no-log policies).
- **Blocked by Some Services**: e.g., Netflix or banking sites may detect VPN use.
